==========
PWR = More People Work Ready

PWR is a web application that brings online job search to the illiterate population.
Non-readers are the most disempowered people in the world and are often unable to benefit from
resources on the internet, which makes tasks like searching for a job much more difficult 
for a population that already has a hard time finding a job. Althought it is useful for all job-seekers,
PWR is a service where both businesses and individuals can post ads directed at people from the non-reading
population who have certain skill-sets. Using PWR, these people will be able to navigate and 
filter job listings based on location, salary range or job-type using a rich audio and picture based UI. 
They are also able to leave audio or video ratings of the employer to help ensure the quality of employers 
and jobs posted. This app is responsive so that users can access it from the mobile web as well. In future 
iterations of this product, PWR will enable a login flow for non-readers as well so that everyone 
is able to post jobs.   

There is a lot of potential to add on to this application and tap a previously untouched market: there are 
one billion people worldwide who are unable to use the internet right now.
